#PROJECT #1
##Friend funds 
This web app will keep track of how much money each friend is spending for the better good. 
There will be a leaderboard. It will be **cool**. 

#How it will work:
If you buy something for the good of the group (snacks, drinks, a new vaccuum...) you will enter the information into the site. You will fill out your name, what you bought, and how much it cost. The program will keep a running tally of who bought what when, and will create a leaderboard showing how much everyone has paid. This way, you can shame the last place person into going on the next beer run, or treat the first place person to fro yo, whatever. Maybe it could also send a text update with the leaderboard scores when they change. 

#Why you need this: 
It is so hard to keep track of how much money everyone in a group has been spending. Dealing with the headache of paying small amounts every time someone buys something is not worth it when you know you're just going to buy more things tomorrow. This keeps it simple and streamlined. If the balance is off at the end of the summer, *then* you can get Venmoing.
